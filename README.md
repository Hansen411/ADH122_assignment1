# ADH122_assignment1


Page descriptions:
I chose to make my website about pretty little liars, the TV show. My five pages include homepage, controversies, two character profiles, and a relationship chart. I chose this as my theme because trashy 2010s teen dramas hold a special place in my heart despite how controversial and horrible written they tend to be.
The Home page includes a basic overview of both the plot of the show and the books it is based on. The Controversies page includes some but not all of the controversial topics the show has attempted to address as well as poor decisions that have not aged well. The two character profiles include basic information about their respective character, while the other 3 character pages are “under construction” but allow you to continue using the navigation bar. Lastly, the relationship chart includes a graph I created that indicates romantic relationships depicted in the show as well as some clarifying information about the graph.

Elements Used:
	I used many instances of "div" as well as "section" as a means of dividing up my different sections of information. Additionally, I used attributes like "img" and "src href" to provide images and links, both to outside sources and to other pages within the assignment.
  
Styles Used:
	I got a lot of assistance from W3Schools [link] when I was making the header navigation bar and I used a youtube tutorial [link] to assist in the creation of the “important Notes” section on the relationship chart page, which is also linked in the comments of the css page. I went for a yellow color scheme because one of the main girls (Alison) is primarily featured in flashbacks for about half the show and she is always depicted in a yellow top.

The java script I used is responsible for the opening and closing of the Important Notes tabs as well as the animation of the arrows associated with those tabs and does satisfy EventListeners.

I am unsure of how to attach the validation verification links as I was only able to do it via file upload, therefore I have attached screenshots of both the CSS and HTML verification pages to the submission on canvas.
