        <h2>Controversy:</h2>
        <p>
          Pretty Little Liars is no stranger to controversy abd has been criticized for many reasons throughout the years, both while it was airing and after it ended. 
          One of the more common critizisms talked about today is the show's potraiyal of relationships between the main cast (highschool aged girls) and adult men. 
          Multiple predatory relationships of this nature have been shown throughout the shows run, but there is one that dominated the scene.
          The most notable of these relationships is between Aria Montgomery and her English teacher, Ezra Fitzgerald.
        </p>
        
        <p>  
          In the pilot episode, Aria Montgomery, 16 years old, begins a relationship with her english teacher Ezra Fitzgerald, who is in his late 20s/early 30s.
          The show will "justify" this relationship by showing that they have a lot in common, and that Ezra "didn't know how old she was" when they first got together.
          However, not only is this is not a valid "excuse" for an adult to be in a relationship with a minor, the show will later reveal that Ezra knew who she was when 
          they met for the first time and that he approached her to "conduct research" for a book he was writing.
          This relationship will continue throughout the entire <i><u>seven seasons</u></i> of the series, with the two eventually getting engaged and planning to get married.
